DESCRIPTION

This program allows the user to experience Disney's Fantasia from the
perspective of the sorcerer's apprentice, Mickey Mouse. The program uses a
Kinect to track the user's position and motion which correspond to animations
on the screen. There is a tutorial mode in which the user is walked through the
possible controls and a play mode in which the user is directly inserted into
the fantasy and can explore the features on his/her own.

INSTALLATION

This program uses Python 3.4, PyKinectV2, and Pygame.
